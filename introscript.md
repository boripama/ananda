Hey everyone, and thanks for watching.

I'm Matthew Thor, and this is Bond Davis, Rick Polidoro and Patrick Gund.

We're here to present to you our project: Ananda, a social web app for endurance athletes.

Ananda's purpose is not only to connect people who share similar passions, but also to find new people for users to connect with based on their training habits.

Our name is inspired by the chemical compound anandamide, which plays a large role in producing the sensation of a "runner's high," and comes from the Sanskrit word "Ananda" meaning bliss or happiness. We thought this married perfectly with our core mission of finding and nurturing friendships.

And that's Ananda. Check it out at Ananda dash runs dot heroku app dot com to start tracking your own runs and making new friends. Thanks for listening, and happy running!
