# Walkthrough

So how does Ananda work?

1. As a user, you would start by either logging in or creating an account.

1. Once you log in, you're brought to a page showing your name, a feed of the activities of your friends, and follower recommendations which are generated by our custom algorithm.

1. You can comment on and like those activities directly from this page.

1. I can also see the details of a single activity or see a user's profile.

1. Me and Cody go way back, so I'm going to follow him.

1. I can also see my totals and manage my account.

1. Lastly, I can upload an activity, which then is displayed on my profile page and for my followers.
